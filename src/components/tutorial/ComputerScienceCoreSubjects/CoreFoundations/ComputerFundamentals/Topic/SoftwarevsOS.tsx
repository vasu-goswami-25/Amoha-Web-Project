      Difference Between Application Software and Operating System
    </h1>

    {/* Intro Paragraph */}
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      A computer executes tasks with the help of software, which is a set of instructions. Software can be broadly divided into system software and application software. 
      The system software, primarily the operating system, manages computer hardware and provides services for other software, while application software performs specific user-oriented tasks.
    </p>

    {/* ================= What is Operating System ================= */}
    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold  mt-6">What is an Operating System?</h2>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      An operating system (OS) is a system software that acts as an interface between the user and computer hardware. 
      It provides essential services for computer programs and manages resources such as memory, processing, and storage. 
      OS is typically developed using languages like C, C++, and assembly.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      <strong>Examples:</strong> Microsoft Windows, Linux, Unix, DOS.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">Types of Operating System</h3>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-lg">
      <li><strong>Batch OS:</strong> Processes batches of jobs without direct user interaction.</li>
      <li><strong>Time-sharing OS:</strong> Allocates time slots for multiple tasks to ensure fair CPU usage.</li>
      <li><strong>Distributed OS:</strong> Manages a network of interconnected computers sharing resources.</li>
      <li><strong>Network OS:</strong> Supports multiple computers connected to a shared server.</li>
      <li><strong>Real-time OS:</strong> Designed to perform tasks within strict time constraints (e.g., airbags, missiles).</li>
    </ul>

    {/* ================= What is Application Software ================= */}
    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold  mt-6">What is Application Software?</h2>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Application software is designed to perform specific tasks for users. It requires an operating system to run and is developed using high-level languages like Java, C, and C++.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      <strong>Examples:</strong> Photoshop, VLC Media Player, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">Types of Application Software</h3>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-lg">
      <li><strong>Freeware:</strong> Free to use, e.g., Adobe Reader, LibreOffice.</li>
      <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Source code available to modify, e.g., GIMP, Apache Web Server.</li>
      <li><strong>Shareware:</strong> Free trial with later payment, e.g., WinZip, Skype.</li>
      <li><strong>Custom Software:</strong> Built for specific users or organizations, e.g., e-commerce solutions.</li>
      <li><strong>Packaged Software:</strong> Bundled programs, e.g., Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint).</li>
    </ul>

    {/* Conclusion */}
    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">Conclusion</h3>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      The operating system provides the foundation for a computer to run, managing hardware and resources, while application software serves specific user needs. 
      Both are essential for a fully functional computing environment.
